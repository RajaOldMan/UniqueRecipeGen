# Unique Recipe Generator
The Unique Recipe Generator will take an ingredient as an input and find ingredients that are 
most commonly used alongside the initial ingredient in recipes. A database of nearly 40,000 recipes is used
to find these ingredients. Additional ingredients are then found that are commonly used with the previously found 
ingredients but are not commonly used with the inputted ingredient. 

The program can be run by executing the recipeGUI.py file.
